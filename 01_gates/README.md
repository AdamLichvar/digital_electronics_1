### De Morgan's laws

1. Equations of all three versions of logic function f(c,b,a):

   ![Logic function](images/equations.png)

2. Listing of VHDL architecture from design file (`design.vhd`) for all three functions. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

```vhdl


```

3. Complete table with logic functions' values:

   | **c** | **b** |**a** | **f_ORIG** | **f_(N)AND** | **f_(N)OR** |
   | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
   | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |  |  |
   | 0 | 0 | 1 |  |  |  |
   | 0 | 1 | 0 |  |  |  |
   | 0 | 1 | 1 |  |  |  |
   | 1 | 0 | 0 |  |  |  |
   | 1 | 0 | 1 |  |  |  |
   | 1 | 1 | 0 |  |  |  |
   | 1 | 1 | 1 |  |  |  |

### Distributive laws

1. Screenshot with simulated time waveforms. Always display all inputs and outputs (display the inputs at the top of the image, the outputs below them) at the appropriate time scale!
